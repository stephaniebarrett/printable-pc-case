# 3D Printable Rackmount PC/Server Case using OpenScad.
## WIP
Currently, creating various [OpenScad](https://openscad.org/) modules to facilitate the design of a modular rackmountable chassis.

Inspired by https://www.printables.com/model/485778-mini-itx-server-rackmount-2u

Requires the [Alpha](https://github.com/thestumbler/alpha) OpenScad library for text rendering.

## Modules
Most of these modules approximate the physical dimensions of various PC components. These are used to estimate positions and clearances of all the parts.
